        Hi! My name is Celine. I am a currently a Student at the University of
        Michigan - Dearborn studying software engineering. I have always had a
        passion for building and problem solving, and through development it has
        allowed me to do just that. Some of my other interests are math and
        finance and I also love playing tennis!
