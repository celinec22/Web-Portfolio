        Hi! My name is Celine. I’m a student at the University of Michigan -
        Dearborn, majoring in Software Engineering. I’ve always been passionate
        about building and problem-solving, and development has given me the
        perfect outlet to do both. Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in
        math and finance, and I also love playing tennis!
